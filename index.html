                <h2>Introduction to Military Airplanes</h2>
                <p>Military airplanes have played a crucial role in warfare for over a century. From their early days as
                    reconnaissance tools to their modern-day use in air superiority, ground attack, and tactical roles,
                    military aircraft have revolutionized how wars are fought. This article explores the evolution and
                    significance of these powerful machines.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Birth of Military Aviation</h2>
                <p>The use of airplanes in warfare began during World War I, with the first combat aircraft being used
                    for reconnaissance and bombing. The <span class="highlight">Sopwith Camel</span> and the <span
                        class="highlight">Fokker Dr.I</span> were among the most famous aircraft of this era, designed
                    primarily for dogfights and gaining air superiority.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Advancements in Technology</h2>
                <p>By World War II, military aircraft technology had made significant advancements. With the development
                    of faster, more maneuverable fighters like the <span class="highlight">P-51 Mustang</span> and the
                    <span class="highlight">Supermarine Spitfire</span>, air forces were able to dominate the skies.
                    Additionally, bombers such as the <span class="highlight">B-17 Flying Fortress</span> provided
                    devastating firepower.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Modern Military Aircraft</h2>
                <p>Today, military airplanes have become incredibly sophisticated machines. The introduction of stealth
                    technology, advanced avionics, and precision weaponry has transformed the landscape of warfare.
                    Aircraft such as the <span class="highlight">F-22 Raptor</span> and the <span class="highlight">F-35
                        Lightning II</span> are capable of conducting a wide range of missions, from air dominance to
                    ground attack and intelligence gathering.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Future of Military Aviation</h2>
                <p>The future of military aviation is marked by the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
                    drones. These aircraft offer unparalleled flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and risk reduction for
                    military operations. Additionally, the exploration of hypersonic speeds and advanced AI systems is
                    expected to usher in a new era of warfare.</p>
